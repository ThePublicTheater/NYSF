			Our Delacorte Investors are a group of civically minded companies whose support ensures The Public’s continued ability to offer the best theater for free. In appreciation for your tax-deductible contribution, your group will receive reserved seats to Shakespeare in the Park at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. This year we are thrilled to offer two different package types: <strong>Event Packages</strong> and <strong>Flexible Packages</strong>.

			Event Packages include a block of tickets to be used for a single performance. Great for hosting a group of clients, executives, or summer associates for an evening in the park.
